<h3><A NAME="sect0">Before the switch engine</A>
 <A HREF="#sect1"><IMG SRC="rarrow.PNG" alt="next"></A></h3><BR>
When Life was first published in October 1970, people tried<BR>
to make infinite-growth patterns, ones that grow without<BR>
limit. Conway realised that there are two ways that such a<BR>
pattern can grow:<BR>
<BR>
Moving source - This encompasses puffers and rakes<BR>
Stationary source - These are guns and slide guns<BR>
<BR>
The first infinite growth pattern was made by Bill Gosper,<BR>
and it was a gun (a stationary object that emits gliders).<BR>
This particular example emits one glider every 30 gens:<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Later, a puffer train (moving object that emits debris)<BR>
was found. It moves at c/2 and has a period-140 output:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00001.rle">

<A NAME="sect1">The discovery of the switch engine</A>
 <A HREF="#sect2"><IMG SRC="rarrow.PNG" alt="next"></A></h3><BR>
<BR>
However, a much smaller, simpler puffer train exists.<BR>
It is completely different to anything else, and is<BR>
called the switch engine. It exists in two different<BR>
forms, both of which are known to occur naturally:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00002.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00002.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
It was discovered by Charles Corderman. The computer he<BR>
used to find it was an unusual hybrid computer, the only one<BR>
of its kind. He did a systematic search for all polyominos<BR>
(patterns consisting of orthogonally-connected cells). When<BR>
running a particular decomino (10-cell polyomino), he noticed<BR>
something strange. The pattern appeared to create itself<BR>
again, 48 generations later, whilst leaving debris. After<BR>
another 48 generations, the pattern is returned to its<BR>
original orientation, translated 8 cells diagonally.<BR>

What if these switch engines could mutually stabilise<BR>
each other to leave no material behind? That is exactly<BR>
what Dean Hickerson did when he created the first<BR>
Cordership, which had 13 switch engines. This was soon<BR>
optimised to 10:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00003.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00003.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
An improved Cordership was built using a similar method.<BR>
This one only requires 7 switch engines:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00004.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00004.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
A 6-engine Cordership with an interesting termination<BR>
was built:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00005.rle">

<A NAME="sect3">Corderguns</A>
 <A HREF="#sect4"><IMG SRC="rarrow.PNG" alt="next"></A></h3><BR>
<BR>
This can be synthesised repeatedly using a gun, but the<BR>
resulting gun is extremely large. It operates at p784:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00006.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00006.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
Much more recently, in 2004, Paul Tooke built a Cordership<BR>
using only 3 switch engines:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00007.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00007.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
This one can be synthesised much more easily, at p690:<BR>

<A NAME="sect4">Swimmers</A>
 <A HREF="#sect5"><IMG SRC="rarrow.PNG" alt="next"></A></h3><BR>
<BR>
A switch engine can travel through a lane made of boats.<BR>
This is called a swimmer track, as the switch engine appears<BR>
to &quot;swim&quot; down it at the slow speed of c/12. The following<BR>
oscillator was made by David Bell in June 2005:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00009.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00009.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
Dave Greene built a stable device that can convert a Herschel<BR>
into a swimmer and back. He made a mistake in the construction,<BR>
so he had to bolt an extra track on. It still works, but is<BR>
reduced to a minimum compression of 629 ticks (generations):<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00010.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00010.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
A Cordership can be quickly transformed into two swimmers.<BR>
The following pattern demonstrates this:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00011.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00011.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
In 2009 I built a converter to turn a single glider<BR>
into a Cordership. You can read about it on this page:<BR>
<BR>

<h3><A HREF="#sect4"><IMG SRC="larrow.PNG" alt="previous"></A>
<A NAME="sect5">Quadratic growth patterns</A>
 <A HREF="#sect6"><IMG SRC="rarrow.PNG" alt="next"></A></h3><BR>
<BR>
The switch engine, since it occurs naturally, can be incorporated<BR>
into a quadratic growth pattern. Such a pattern would synthesise<BR>
a block-laying or glider-producing switch engine at a regular rate.<BR>
One notable example consists of just 38 cells (by Mitchell Riley):<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00012.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00012.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
It produces a switch engine every 140 generations (notice the<BR>
similarity with the puffer train mentioned at the start of<BR>
this article).<BR>
<BR>
A more traditional breeder that synthesises switch engines uses<BR>
glider collisions. This was the method used in the very first<BR>
quadratic growth pattern, made by Bill Gosper. Whereas his<BR>
design spawned copies of his gun, the switch engine breeder<BR>
creates switch engines periodically. This example was built<BR>
in 1997 by Helmut Postl:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00013.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00013.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
It fills space more densely than Riley's breeder, synthesising<BR>
a switch engine every 80 (instead of 140) generations.<BR>
<BR>
The smallest (in terms of bounding box) quadratic growth pattern<BR>
does not rely on the switch engine, but instead stretches a<BR>
uniform agar. It is unimaginatively called the spacefiller:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/pic00014.lif">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00014.png"></A><BR><BR>
Switch engine technology is not restricted to linear and<BR>
quadratic growth. Other growth rates are possible, such<BR>
as Bill Gosper's linear-logarithmic growth pattern.<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00015.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00015.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
The pattern is very slow, so I suggest using a very<BR>
powerful program to run it. Personally I would reccomend<BR>
Golly, but Hashlife is equally equipped to simulate it.<BR>
<BR>

<A NAME="sect6">Puffers and rakes</A>
 <A HREF="#sect7"><IMG SRC="rarrow.PNG" alt="next"></A></h3><BR>
<BR>
Corderships can be used to build diagonal puffers and<BR>
rakes. These are moving objects that leave behind<BR>
other objects. A simple example is this puffer which<BR>
builds heavyweight switch engines:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00016.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00016.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
LWSS and MWSS rakes can be made using a different<BR>
method:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00017.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00017.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00018.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00018.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
Standard spaceships aren't the only things that can<BR>
be built. A more complex construction generates switch<BR>
engines, resulting in another quadratic-growth pattern:<BR>
<BR>
<BR><A HREF="corder_patterns/rle00019.rle">
<IMG SRC="corder_patterns/img00019.png"></A><BR><BR>
<BR>
And taking the idea one step further, David Bell has<BR>
built an arrangement of Corderships which synthesises<BR>
more Corderships, travelling perpendicular to the<BR>
rake.<BR>
