# isotropic-rule-gen.py, version 1.1 for Python3
# Change from v1.0:
#    added @ICONS section to output rule, to avoid triggering shared-rule logic in Golly
#    13 Dec 2021: ran 2to3 online converter to get rid of iteritems() call

# isotropic-rule.py / isotropicRulegen.py
# Auxillary rule generator from wildmyron's non-totalistic version of apgsearch
# The rulespace is the set of isotropic non-totalistic rules on the Moore
# neighbourhood, using Alan Hensel's notation.
# See http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/neighbors2.html
# Generate a rule table for an isotropic rule using Alan Hensel's
# isotropic, non-totalistic rule format for CA on the Moore neighbourhood
